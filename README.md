# AdventOfCode2017

This is the first time I'm participating in the Advent of Code challenge: https://adventofcode.com/2017

I've decided at the outset to solve all problems in object-oriented programming with C++, and I specifically wanted to focus on test driven development, which means writing loads of unit tests.

A lot of my solutions are way overengineered, but if the goal was to have fun (and come up with the correct solutions), this has been a huge success.
